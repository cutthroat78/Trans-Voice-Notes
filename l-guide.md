# L's Voice Training Guide for MTF transgender vocal feminization

## Introduction

Hey, friend. Want to change your voice? Well... you can - that's an option.

Your voice is much more malleable than you may realize. There are at least a dozen different dimensions that you can learn to control independently to change the sound of your voice. The way you talk right now is not your one "true" voice, it is a habit. A habit that can be changed, if you so choose.

I like to come at this challenge from two angles. One is to break down all the muscle movements involved and learn to manipulate them individually, through simple drills. The other is to listen to carefully selected example voices and learn to imitate them, intuitively. You will get results much faster by using both, as you do in this guide.

My approach to voice training is not a process of feminization. It is a journey in flexibility, to full fluency over the entire possibility space of your voice. This guide is aimed at those of you who are already comfortable in the masculine end of the spectrum. With the exercises I've gathered here, you will familiarize yourself with the feminine end - and everything in between.

Once you have gained complete freedom across your vocal range, you can choose exactly where you'd like to live - whether that is within one voice, or two. Or three. Masculine, feminine, or androgynous, young or old, human or cartoon. Any or all. It's up to you.

So now, **listen to [this clip](https://clyp.it/5eq3io3u)** to hear me demonstrate the eight most important elements for vocal feminization, gradually transforming a masculine voice into a feminine one. Then, **listen to [this clip](https://clyp.it/ggetrab2)** to hear how they sound one at a time, in isolation. With practice, you can learn to do this too!

Most of the material in this guide can be traced back to the pioneering work of [Zheanna Erose](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZheannaErose) of [TransVoiceLessons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA), as well as the excellent free tutorial videos at [New York Vocal Coaching](https://www.youtube.com/user/NewYorkVocalCoaching). Many thanks, also, to the [Scinguistics](https://cramdvoicelessons.blog/about/) community, and of course, all of you lovely people here on [r/transvoice](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/)!

I've organized this guide into four levels, from Foundations to Mastery, each split into three subsections. You could easily spend a month on each level - a week or two per subsection. But you don't have to master each subsection before moving on to the next. Just give yourself enough time to digest the material and get a feel for it, and then start the next subsection as soon as you no longer feel overwhelmed.

Ready? Let's begin.
